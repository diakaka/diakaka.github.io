I am He Yi, a senior undergraduate majoring in financial engineering at the School of Finance, Renmin University of China. I am about to enter Guanghua School of Management of Peking University to study for a master's degree in finance.

I've done some reseach work in corporate finance and economics, including some rough cross-research between economics, politics and history. One of my favorite class is intermediate microeconomics conducted by Professor Bin Miao in RUC.

In November 2023, I gave up scientific research because I could not find the value of research in cleaning data and creating conclusions, and could not make meaningful research anymore though I worked hard with some Pre-Phds.

I am an optimistic girl. My mbti is infp. My hobbies include word puzzles, watching TV series and movies. Welcome to contact me!
